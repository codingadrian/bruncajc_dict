## Description

This is a dictionary made to try and recover the [Boruca language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruca_language), it intends to facilitate acquiring new vocabulary for every day conversation.

The Boruca language is indigenous to Costa Rica, it is considered to be nearly extinct, although a few words and phrases can still be heard among the Boruca people

At the moment the only documents in Boruca are a couple of books and dictionaries, all printed and barely a few dozen words in digital format. This dictionary is design to provide a compilation of all known entries and become a go-to resource for learning the language.

## Features

* Collects all words in the [Diccionario Boruca-Espanol Espanol-Boruca by Miquel Angel Quesada](http://editorial.ucr.ac.cr/lenguas/item/1769-diccionario-boruca-espanol-espanol-boruca.html)

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, if you have any skills in programming or linguistics and you are interested in language revival, please jump in!

If you wish to use this code to work with a different language, please do so, and let me know, I'd like to see your work.

## Authors and acknowledgement

My name is Adrian Robles Fuentes, and I am a linguistics aficionado and self-tough front-end developer. I love the Boruca language and want to leave my grain of sand by creating an application that helps its revival.

I would like first to say thanks to Espiritu Santo Maroto for inspiring me to learn Boruca, also to Miguel A. Quesada for compiling the dictionary that is the base of this application.
