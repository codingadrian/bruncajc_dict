The Boruca language is indigenous to Costa Rica, it is considered to be nearly extinct, although a few words and phrases can still be heard among the Boruca people

At the moment the only documents in Boruca are a couple of books and dictionaries, all printed and barely a few dozen words in digital format. This dictionary is design to provide a compilation of all known entries and become a go-to resource for learning the language.
